# Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added

- **Tag Inheritance Query Patterns** - Production-tested patterns for querying tag hierarchies
  - Complete documentation of `:logseq.property.class/extends` attribute for tag parent relationships
  - Working `or-join` pattern for finding items with parent tag OR any child tags
  - Real-world example: Query all #task items including #shopping, #feedback, etc. that extend #task
  - Use case: Essential for plugins working with tag taxonomies and derived relationships
  - Location: `references/queries-and-database.md` (~140 new lines)

- **Disjunctive Query Patterns with or-join** - Solve "free vars" errors in complex queries
  - Comprehensive explanation of when `or-join [?vars]` is required vs. standard `or`
  - Error example showing "All clauses in 'or' must use same set of free vars" issue
  - Solution pattern with explicit variable unification
  - Multiple working examples combining tag inheritance with property filters
  - Location: `references/queries-and-database.md` and `references/pitfalls-and-solutions.md` (Pitfall #9)

- **:block/title vs :block/name Documentation** - Clear explanation of tag attribute differences
  - Table comparing both attributes: display name vs. normalized name
  - When to use each: `:block/title` (case-sensitive, "Task") vs. `:block/name` (lowercase, "task")
  - Context-specific recommendations: Plugin queries vs. app query blocks vs. CLI
  - Best practice: Use `:block/title` throughout for consistency with user-visible names
  - Location: `references/queries-and-database.md`

- **Query Context Guide** - Same Datalog syntax across different execution contexts
  - Plugin API: `logseq.DB.datascriptQuery(query)`
  - App query blocks: Direct Datalog in `{:query [...]}`
  - CLI: `logseq query` command with escaped syntax
  - Key differences documented: string wrapping, format requirements, execution environment
  - Location: `references/queries-and-database.md`

- **Tag Hierarchy Creation Example** - Practical example in core APIs
  - Step-by-step code showing how to create parent-child tag relationships
  - Uses `addTagExtends()` API to establish inheritance
  - Cross-reference to query patterns in queries-and-database.md
  - Location: `references/core-apis.md`

- **Pitfall #9: or Clause Variable Mismatch** - Common query error and solution
  - Problem: "All clauses in 'or' must use same set of free vars" error message
  - Cause: Using standard `or` with branches that have different variables
  - ❌ WRONG example showing the error
  - ✅ CORRECT solution using `or-join [?b]`
  - How or-join works: Explicitly declare which variables must unify
  - Cross-reference to complete query patterns

### What This Means

Before v2.1.0, the skill documented basic Datalog queries but lacked patterns for:
- Querying tag hierarchies (items tagged with child tags)
- Combining query branches with different variables
- Understanding tag attribute differences

After v2.1.0:
- ✅ Query items with parent tags OR any child tags that extend them
- ✅ Write complex disjunctive queries without "free vars" errors
- ✅ Understand when to use :block/title vs. :block/name
- ✅ Know how queries work across different contexts (plugin/app/CLI)
- ✅ Avoid common or-join pitfalls with documented solutions
- ✅ Create and query tag taxonomies confidently

**This update elevates the skill from basic queries to advanced tag taxonomy patterns.**

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-15

### 🎯 Major Restructuring: Modular Documentation

**BREAKING CHANGE**: SKILL.md restructured from monolithic file (~3,200 lines) to modular architecture with references/ directory.

This is a **major version bump** because the skill structure has fundamentally changed. While the content is preserved, the way it's organized and loaded is different.

### Added

- **Modular Reference Files** - Created 7 specialized reference files:
  - `references/event-handling.md` (~270 lines) - DB.onChanged patterns, debouncing strategies
  - `references/plugin-architecture.md` (~577 lines) - Best practices, file organization, settings
  - `references/tag-detection.md` (~175 lines) - Multi-layered detection approach
  - `references/property-management.md` (~227 lines) - Property iteration, namespaced keys
  - `references/queries-and-database.md` (~160 lines) - Datalog patterns, caching
  - `references/pitfalls-and-solutions.md` (~220 lines) - Common errors and fixes
  - `references/core-apis.md` (~200 lines) - Essential API methods quick reference

- **Progressive Disclosure Pattern**
  - Three-level loading: metadata → SKILL.md → references
  - Context-efficient documentation loading
  - Only load relevant content when needed

- **Search Patterns** - Added grep-friendly patterns for finding specific topics
  - Example: `DB.onChanged`, `debouncing`, `transaction datoms` for event handling
  - Example: `hasTag`, `block.properties.tags undefined` for tag detection

### Changed

- **SKILL.md** - Complete rewrite as lean hub file
  - Reduced from 3,200+ lines to ~420 lines (87% reduction)
  - Now serves as entry point with overview and quick start
  - References modular files for detailed content
  - Updated version from 1.8.0 to 2.0.0

- **README.md** - Updated to reflect new structure
  - Added "Major Restructuring: Modular Documentation" section
  - Explained benefits and how to use modular structure
  - Updated version to 2.0.0
  - Preserved v1.8.0 content in "Previous Updates" section

### Benefits

- ✅ **87% size reduction** - SKILL.md: 3,200+ lines → 420 lines
- ✅ **Faster loading** - Core guidance available immediately
- ✅ **Better organization** - Each file has clear scope
- ✅ **Easier maintenance** - Update one file without affecting others
- ✅ **Context efficiency** - Claude only loads relevant documentation

### Content Preservation

**IMPORTANT**: All content from v1.8.0 has been preserved and reorganized. Nothing was lost in the restructuring:
- Event-driven updates → `references/event-handling.md`
- Multi-layered tag detection → `references/tag-detection.md`
- Property value iteration → `references/property-management.md`
- Plugin architecture → `references/plugin-architecture.md`
- Core APIs → `references/core-apis.md`
- Queries → `references/queries-and-database.md`
- Pitfalls → `references/pitfalls-and-solutions.md`

### New Structure

```
logseq-db-plugin-api-skill/
├── SKILL.md                          # Lean entry point (~420 lines)
└── references/                       # Modular detailed docs
    ├── core-apis.md                  # Essential API methods

    ├── tag-detection.md              # Multi-layered detection
    └── pitfalls-and-solutions.md     # Common errors & fixes
```

### Migration Notes

If you've been using v1.8.0:
- The skill will continue to work - just update to v2.0.0
- All content is still available, just organized differently
- SKILL.md now provides overview and references detailed files
- Claude automatically loads reference files as needed
